Downloads playlists off of youtube, turns audio only files into mp3

This is just something I made after getting frustrated at the plethora of spam and virus ads from tools on the internet.
Also because there's no limit on playlist size when u make it yourself.

I included 2 empty subdirectories, 1 for music, 1 for video. The folder for music is needed since the program uses it to isolate files slated for extension changes (all downloads start off as mp4s).
